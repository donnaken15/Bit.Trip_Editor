(This line may be deleted) Describe what the bug does or how it affects the game or when it happens.
You can include a piece of media with your issue to better describe what it may be.
If an error in red is shown on screen when this occurs, be sure to include what it
says so we can find where that error happens in the code and fix it, or enable LogErrors
in your INI to catch your error.
