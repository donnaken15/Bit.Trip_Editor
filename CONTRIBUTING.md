# CONTRIBUTING
is welcome, via making levels, reporting bugs, sharing suggestions, sharing code for the project, and/or becoming part of the community

## Making levels
would help spread awareness for the engine and get some people interested

It will also be of support to me because I'll know that people are investing time in the project and making more space for addictive gameplay

To make levels, check out [the forum post on how to, here](https://bittripeditor.boards.net/thread/5/make-level)

I'd really like to see what can be done with the engine

## Reporting bugs
help the game become more stable and find and fix code

To do so, simply open an issue here or make a thread on the forum

## Sharing suggestions
should be straight to the point. Let me know what you'd like to see and what to be added that makes things fun

## Sharing code
is not common or necessary, but is appreciated to strengthen the engine

Maybe I'll credit you and/or give you a forum rank for your help

## Becoming a part of the community
will signify that you are enjoying the project and want to see more to come and more to make

You can join the community by joining the forums: https://bittripeditor.boards.net



I thank you for any of the above you've done, and/or especially for if you're just playing the engine, because it shows that I helped to (re)make something cool

Again, thank you :D
